REST API- Representational State Transfer Application Program interface.
          REST is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems.
     
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> What is REST? <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
     	is an architecture style, not a standard
     	Everything is a Resource
     	Resource identification through URI
     	  - Uniform interface- fixed set for CRUD operations
     	  - Accessed by HTTP methods
     	Resources are decoupled from their representation
     	  - Rest uses various representations to represent a resource, e.g JSON or XML
     	in Rest architecture 
     	  - Web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture.
     	  - Rest Server simply provides access to resources
     	  - Rest client accesses and modifies the resources like text, JSON , XML>
     	Web services based on REST architecture are called RESTful web services. 
     
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> What is REST architecture ? <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
        * State-less client-server architecture
            - REST server simply provides access to resources.
            - Rest client accesses and modifies the resources.
            - RESTful web services should not keep a client state on server
            - Responsibility of the client to pass its context to server.
        * Use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture.
        * Stateful interactions through hyperlinks
            - Every interaction with a resource is stateless
            - Stateful interactions are based on the concept of explicit state transfer. 
          
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP methods- GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
HTTP Status codes- 200, 404.

Key Abstraction-Resource
A resource has an URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
    -> /users/Ranga/todos/1
    -> /users/Ranga/todos
    -> /users/Ranga
A resource can have different representations
    -> XML
    -> HTML
    -> JSON
    examples:-
    -> Create a User - Post /users
    -> Delete a User - DELETE /users/1
    -> Get all Users - GET /users
    -> Get one User - GET /users/1
@ControllerAdvise - it's applicable to all the controllers defined in project when use this annotation at customized exception.
	Eg:- when extend ResponseEntityExceptionHandler there you can use this annotation.
	
Observations	
	1.package names should match with src/main/java with others
	2.controller paths shouldn't match with other methods or endpoints.
