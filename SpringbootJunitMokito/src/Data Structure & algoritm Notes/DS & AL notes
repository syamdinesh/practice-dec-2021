Data Structures:-
    1. Program-->  A program is set of instructions which performs operation on data--> When the program is dealing wiht data how it will organize the data in the main memory that's where Data Structure is used.
    2. A Data Structure is a way of organizing and hold data in some manner so later it can be accessed, queried or updated easily and quickly.

Algorithm:-
    A process or set of steps to do a cetain task.
        eg:-  Search Algo--> Process or set of steps to search.
              Sort Algo--> Process or set of steps to sort in a praticular sequence.
    Algorithms are performed on data structure.

How to define good code?
    1. Readable
    2. Scalable :- Time coplexity --> Amount of time it takes to run an algorithm
                   Space or memory complexity--> Amount of extra space our algorithm requires.

Big O notation rates the which is the best solution ( a problem has multiple solutions. ).

BIG O--> This notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
         Big O is used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.
         To measure the efficiency of an algorithm, we need to consider two things:
            Time complexity:- How much time does it take to run completely?
            Space Complexity:- How much extra space does it require in the process?
