toString():- toString() provides String representation of an Object and used to convert an object to String. 
             The default toString() method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, 
             the at-sign character `@â€™, and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object.
             It is always recommended to override toString() method to get our own String representation of Object.
hashCode():- 1. For every object, JVM generates a unique number which is hascode. 
             2. A common misconception about this method is that hashCode() method returns the address of object,which is not correct.It converts the internal address of object to an integer by using an algorithm.
             3. The hashCode() method is native because in Java it is impossible to find address of an object, so it uses native languages like C/C++ to find address of the object.
             4. Use of hashCode() method : Returns a hash value that is used to search object in a collection. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) uses hashcode method while saving objects into hashing related data structures like HashSet, HashMap, Hashtable etc. 
                The main advantage of saving objects based on hash code is that searching becomes easy.
