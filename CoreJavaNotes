Use stream operations to express sophisticated data processing queries.
First, typical processing patterns on collections
Second, how can we process really large collections efficiently? Ideally, to speed up the processing, you want to leverage multicore architectures. However, writing parallel code is hard and error-prone.
Java SE 8 to the rescue! The Java API designers are updating the API with a new abstraction called Stream that lets you process data in a declarative way. Furthermore, streams can leverage multi-core architectures without you having to write a single line of multithread code. Sounds good, doesn’t it? That’s what this series of articles will explore.
