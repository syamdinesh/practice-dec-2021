Shallow copy - it copies reference of original object. Eg:- intArr1[]= intArr2[]; (if you modifies this array inbetween {3, 7, 9} ->{13, 7 ,9}).
Deep copy - it creates a new object with exact data. Eg:- {3, 7, 9} -> {3, 7, 9}. 

-------------------
 when to use what
------------------
There is no hard and fast rule defined for selecting between shallow copy and deep copy 
but normally we should keep in mind that if an object has only primitive fields, then obviously we should go for shallow copy,
but if the object has references to other objects, then based on the requirement, shallow copy or deep copy should be done.
