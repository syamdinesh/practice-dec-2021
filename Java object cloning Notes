Shallow copy - it copies reference of original object. Eg:- intArr1[]= intArr2[]; (if you modifies this array inbetween {3, 7, 9} ->{13, 7 ,9}).
Deep copy - it creates a new object with exact data. Eg:- {3, 7, 9} -> {3, 7, 9}. 

-------------------
 when to use what
------------------
There is no hard and fast rule defined for selecting between shallow copy and deep copy 
but normally we should keep in mind that if an object has only primitive fields, then obviously we should go for shallow copy,
but if the object has references to other objects, then based on the requirement, shallow copy or deep copy should be done.

----------
Lazy Copy 
----------
A lazy copy can be defined as a combination of both shallow copy and deep copy. The mechanism follows a simple approach â€“ at the initial state, 
shallow copy approach is used. A counter is also used to keep a track on how many objects share the data. When the program wants to modify the original object, 
it checks whether the object is shared or not. If the object is shared, then the deep copy mechanism is initiated.

--------
Summary 
--------
In shallow copy, only fields of primitive data type are copied while the objects references are not copied. 
Deep copy involves the copy of primitive data type as well as object references. There is no hard and fast rule as to when to do shallow copy and when to do a deep copy.
